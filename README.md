# IDW Interpolation Prediction Analysis inn R
Using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation to create prediction surfaces in R.
Using R to create interpolation (IDW) surfaces to predict distribution of N02, PM_25 and O3 from Air Quality data collected from sensors across USA.


## Data Source
The EPA provides many prepared datasets. Airquality data for year 2000 will be used in this analysis
In this exercise, the Annual Summary Data  for will be used â€“ Concentrations by Monitor:
